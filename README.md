## How does the project work?
1. 'Go home' link brings you to the home page 
2. All posts are displayed on the home page 
3. Name of each post on the main page is a link which brings you to specific post view
4. On the one post view page you have next opportunities: 
  * Edit the post via Edit button
  * Delete the post via the Delete button
  * Leave your comment via the form at the bottom
5. After editing a post, you will be brought to edited post page 
6. After deleting a post you will be brought to page with all posts

##According to the challenge
1. Time and author of posts are not implemented because of API does not provide this information. It's possible to do with static data, but not 100% sure it's needed.
2. It's possible to improve the project by adding PropTypes to  checking all props.
